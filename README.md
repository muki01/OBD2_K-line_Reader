This code is for reading the K-Linke in Cars. With this code you can read sensor values, troubleshoot codes and more. It is compatible with ISO9141 and ISO14230(KWP slow and fast) protocols.
I have shared schematics to communicate with the car. You can use these schematics or you can make another one. I used Arduino nano and ESP32 C3 as microcontrollers, but you can use another microcontrollers like STM32, ESP8266 and much more.

I will share more information about K-Line protocols and communication later. Stay tuned 😉.

You can also see my other car projects:
1. [Тhis](https://github.com/muki01/I-K_Bus) project is for BMW with I/K bus system. 
2. [Тhis](https://github.com/muki01/OBD2_CAN_Bus_Reader) project is for Cars with CAN Bus.

## ⚙️Instalation
* If you just want to test, you can use the [Basic_Code](https://github.com/muki01/OBD2_K-line_Reader/tree/main/Basic_Code). This code extracts the data to the serial monitor. It is compatible with Arduino and ESP32. [Here](https://github.com/muki01/OBD2_K-line_Reader/blob/main/Basic_Code/README.md) are the instructions on how this code works and how to install.
* If you want to see the retreaved data in the Web Site you can use [WebServer_Code](https://github.com/muki01/OBD2_K-line_Reader/tree/main/WebServer_Code). It is compatible with All ESP32 and ESP8266 board. [Here](https://github.com/muki01/OBD2_K-line_Reader/tree/main/WebServer_Code/README.md) are the instructions on how this code works and how to install.
